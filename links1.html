  <!-- In this task we want you to help fill in the links on our Whales information page:

    The first link should be linked to a page called whales.html, which is in the same directory as the current page.
    We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.
    The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as "whales@example.com".
    You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales". -->
